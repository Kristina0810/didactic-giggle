## Step 1: Account Setup & Optimization (30 minutes)

### 1.1 Create Instagram Account

**Account Type:** Personal (NOT business initially - better reach)

**Username Strategy:**

**Option A: Aspirational Name** (luxury lifestyle vibe)
- @luxe.lifestyle.sophia
- @elegance.by.maya
- @luxe.living.elena

**Option B: Personal Brand** (if using your real name)
- @yourname
- @yourname.lifestyle
- @yourname.official

**Pro Tip:** Keep it simple, easy to spell, memorable. Avoid numbers/underscores.

### 1.2 Profile Optimization

**Profile Photo:**
- Use your best AI-generated headshot
- Professional, high-quality, clear face
- Consistent with account aesthetic

**Bio Formula:**
```
[Who you are] 🌟 [What you do]
[Your niche/expertise] ✨ [Value proposition]
[Call-to-action] 👇

[Link]
```

**Example Bio:**
```
Luxury Lifestyle & AI Content Creator 🌟
Teaching you how to create stunning AI visuals ✨
From photos to influencer in 8 weeks 💎
DM "START" for free guide 👇

```

**Bio Best Practices:**
- ✅ Emojis (visual, breaks up text)
- ✅ Clear value proposition (what's in it for followers?)
- ✅ Call-to-action (tells people what to do)
- ✅ Link to free resource (builds email list - critical!)

### 1.3 Highlights Setup

**Create 5-7 Instagram Highlights:**

1. **✨ About** - Introduce yourself, your journey
2. **🎨 AI Art** - Best AI-generated images
3. **📚 Tutorials** - Quick tips, behind-the-scenes
4. **💬 Q&A** - Answer common questions
5. **🎓 Course** - Teasers, testimonials (once you have them)
6. **✈️ Lifestyle** - Luxury content, aspirational
7. **🎁 Free Stuff** - Lead magnets, downloads

**Cover images:** Use branded, consistent aesthetic (Canva templates work great)

---

## Step 2: Content Strategy (Weeks 1-8)

### 2.1 Content Pillars (80/20 Rule)

**80% Value Content** (builds authority, trust):
- AI tutorials ("How I create consistent characters")
- Before/after comparisons (raw photo → AI result)
- Process videos (screen recordings of ComfyUI workflow)
- Tips and tricks (prompt engineering, LoRA training)
- Mistakes to avoid (your learning journey)

**20% Lifestyle Content** (aspiration, engagement):
- Luxury lifestyle posts (AI-generated scenes)
- Travel content (AI-generated destinations)
- Fashion inspiration
- Motivational quotes (on-brand imagery)

**Why 80/20?** Value builds authority → Authority builds trust → Trust drives sales

### 2.2 Weekly Posting Schedule

**Daily Posting (7 posts/week):**

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| **Mon** | Tutorial | "How to train your first LoRA in 60 minutes" |
| **Tue** | Process | Screen recording of ComfyUI workflow |
| **Wed** | Before/After | "From iPhone photo to Instagram-worthy AI art" |
| **Thu** | Tip/Trick | "5 prompts that make your character consistent" |
| **Fri** | Lifestyle | Luxury AI-generated scene (aspirational) |
| **Sat** | Q&A | "Top 5 questions about AI character creation" |
| **Sun** | Behind-the-scenes | Your setup, challenges, wins |

**+ Instagram Stories (3-5/day):**
- Morning: Personal/lifestyle (coffee, workout, morning routine)
- Midday: Value (quick tip, tutorial clip, engagement poll)
- Evening: Behind-the-scenes (working on course, generating content)

[Hook: Relatable story opening]

[Challenge/obstacle]

[How you overcame it]

[Lesson learned]

[Call-to-action]

Example:

6 months ago I had ZERO AI knowledge 🤯

Downloaded ComfyUI... completely overwhelmed. Gave up 3 times.

Then I found the LoRA + IPAdapter + ControlNet stack. Game changer.

Now I run a 6-figure AI content business (and you can too).

The key? World-class output + user-friendly education. That's what I teach.

DM "COURSE" to get early access 🚀

**Caption Best Practices:**
- ✅ Hook in first sentence (grab attention in feed)
- ✅ Line breaks (easy to read on mobile)
- ✅ Personal stories (builds connection)
- ✅ Value first, promotion second
- ✅ Clear CTA (tell them what to do)
- ✅ 5-10 relevant hashtags (not 30 - looks spammy)

---

## Step 3: Growth Tactics (Weeks 3-6)

### 3.1 Hashtag Strategy

**Use 3 tiers of hashtags** (5-10 total per post):

**Tier 1: Niche** (10K-100K posts)
- #LoRAtraining
- #ComfyUI
- #AIcharacter
- #CharacterConsistency

**Tier 2: Category** (100K-1M posts)
- #AIartwork
- #DigitalCreator
- #ContentStrategy
- #AIinfluencer

**Tier 3: Broad** (1M-10M posts)
- #AIart
- #DigitalArt
- #ContentCreation

**Why 3 Tiers?**
- Niche: Easier to rank, highly targeted audience
- Category: Moderate competition, quality followers
- Broad: Hard to rank, but massive reach potential

**Pro Tip:** Research competitors' hashtags, find which ones they rank for, use those.

### 3.2 Engagement Strategy (1 hour/day)

**Daily Engagement Routine:**

**30 minutes before posting:**
1. Find 10 accounts in your niche (search hashtags)
2. Like their last 3 posts
3. Leave thoughtful comments (not "nice!" - ask questions, add value)
4. Follow if they align with your brand

**30 minutes after posting:**
1. Respond to ALL comments on your post (within 1 hour = algorithm boost)
2. Like every comment
3. Ask follow-up questions (encourages more comments)

**Result:** Algorithm sees high engagement → shows your content to more people → faster growth

### 3.3 Collaboration & Shoutouts

**Week 4-6: Find collaboration partners**

**Strategy:**
1. Find 5-10 accounts with 500-2000 followers (similar size)
2. DM: "Hey [name]! Love your AI content. Would you be interested in a story shoutout swap? I feature you, you feature me. Win-win for growth 🚀"
3. Coordinate posting (same day for maximum impact)

**Expected Result:** 10-50 new followers per collaboration

**Micro-influencer outreach** (5K-20K followers):
- Offer free course access in exchange for story mention
- Most will accept (they want free stuff, you want exposure)

---

## Step 4: Building Authority & Trust (Weeks 5-6)

### 4.1 Behind-the-Scenes Content

**Share your journey authentically:**
- Screen recordings of your workflow
- Mistakes and failures (relatable, builds trust)
- Wins and successes (aspirational, inspiring)
- Time-lapses of content creation

**Instagram Stories (daily):**
- "Creating 50 images today - follow along!"
- Polls: "Which outfit should I generate next?"
- Q&A stickers: "Ask me anything about AI art"
- "This Week" stickers: Share your progress

### 4.2 Free Value (Lead Magnets)

**Create 1-2 free downloads:**

**Option 1: Free PDF Guide**
- "10 ComfyUI Prompts for Character Consistency"
- "My Exact LoRA Training Settings (That Generated 10K+ Images)"

**Option 2: Free Mini-Course**
- 3-day email course: "Character Consistency Crash Course"
- Day 1: LoRA basics
- Day 2: IPAdapter + ControlNet
- Day 3: Batch generation workflow

**Delivery:**
- Use Gumroad (free), SendFox (email), or Carrd (landing page)
- Link in bio: "Get my free guide 👇"
- DM automation: "DM me START" → auto-send link (ManyChat free tier)

**Why Free Stuff?**
- Builds email list (you OWN this, not Instagram)
- Demonstrates expertise (they trust you to teach paid course)
- Warms up cold audience (free → paid conversion easier)

---

## Step 5: Course Promotion Funnel (Weeks 7-8)

### 5.1 Pre-Launch (Week 7)

**Monday-Wednesday: Tease**
- "I'm launching something next week that will change how you create AI content..."
- "50 beta testers just finished my course. Results are 🤯"
- Polls: "What's your biggest challenge with AI character creation?"

**Thursday-Friday: Reveal**
- "Announcing: [Course Name] - From Zero to AI Influencer in 30 Days"
- Outline what's included (modules, workflows, templates)
- Early bird pricing: "$99 → $49 for first 20 people"

**Saturday-Sunday: Build urgency**
- "48 hours until early bird ends..."
- "12 spots left at $49..."
- Countdown timer in stories

### 5.2 Launch Week (Week 8)

**Monday: LAUNCH**
- Post announcement (feed + stories)
- Email list (if you have one)

**Tuesday-Thursday: Social proof**

**Friday-Sunday: Final push**
- "Last 3 days at launch price..."
- "Going from $49 → $99 on Monday"
- Final testimonials
- Answer objections in stories (Q&A)

### 5.3 Sales Page Essentials

**Use Gumroad, Stan Store, or Carrd**

**Must-Have Elements:**
1. **Hero section:** Big transformation promise
   - "From Zero to AI Influencer in 30 Days (Even if You've Never Used AI Before)"
2. **Social proof:** Testimonials, results, before/afters
3. **What's included:** Module breakdown, bonuses, templates
4. **Guarantee:** "If you don't generate your first 50 images in Week 1, full refund"
5. **Pricing:** Clear pricing, urgency (limited spots, price increase)
6. **CTA:** Big, clear "Enroll Now" button

**Pricing Strategy:**
- **Early bird:** $49 (first 20 people)
- **Launch week:** $79 (week 1)
- **Regular price:** $99-149 (after launch)

## Step 6: First Sales & Iteration (Week 8+)

### 6.1 Expected Results

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 1,000 followers by Week 8
- 2-5% conversion rate (20-50 students)
- $49-99 per student
- **Revenue: $980-$4,950**

**Optimistic Estimate:**

- 5-10% conversion rate (100-200 students)
- $49-99 per student
- **Revenue: $4,900-$19,800**

**Reality Check:** Most first launches = 10-40 sales. That's still $490-$3,960 for 8 weeks of work!

### 6.2 Post-Launch Strategy

**Once you have students:**

**Week 9-12: Deliver, gather testimonials**
- Support students in private community (Facebook Group, Discord)

- Consistent Instagram content (80% value, 20% promotion)

**Month 4-6: Scale**
- Paid ads (Instagram ads, Facebook ads) - use testimonials
- Affiliate program (students promote for 20-30% commission)
- Price increase ($99 → $149) - scarcity/urgency
- **Target: $5K-$10K/month recurring**

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm posting but not growing"

**Common Mistakes:**
1. **No engagement routine** → Spend 1 hour/day engaging with others
2. **Hashtags too broad** → Use niche hashtags (10K-100K posts)
3. **No clear value proposition** → Make it obvious what you teach
4. **Inconsistent posting** → Post daily for 60 days minimum

**Fix:** Audit top 3 competitors - what are they doing that you're not?

### "People aren't buying my course"

**Common Objections:**
1. **"Too expensive"** → Offer payment plan ($49/month x 2)
2. **"Will this work for me?"** → Share beginner testimonials, guarantee
3. **"I don't have time"** → Emphasize 30 minutes/day gets results
4. **"I'm not tech-savvy"** → Show behind-the-scenes, screen recordings (it's easier than they think)

**Fix:** Run Q&A sessions in stories, address objections head-on

### "I have followers but low engagement"

**Causes:**
1. **Wrong audience** → Using broad hashtags, not niche
2. **No call-to-action** → Tell people to comment, share, DM
3. **Boring captions** → Use storytelling, emotion, vulnerability

**Fix:** Analyze top 5 posts (highest engagement) - what do they have in common? Do more of that.

## Pro Tips

**Consistency > Perfection:**
- Posting daily with 7/10 quality > posting weekly with 10/10 quality
- Algorithm rewards consistency

**Authenticity Wins:**
- Share your mistakes, learning journey, struggles
- People connect with real humans, not perfect influencers

**Email List is GOLD:**
- Instagram can ban you tomorrow (you lose everything)
- Email list = you own it forever
- Build it from Day 1

**Patience Pays:**
- First 60 days = slow growth (normal)
- Day 60-180 = exponential growth (if consistent)
- Don't quit before the curve

## Next Steps: Scaling to $10K/Month

**Month 3-6 Plan:**

1. **Increase course price** ($99 → $149) - you're more established now
2. **Launch advanced course** ($297 - advanced workflows, monetization strategies)
3. **Paid ads** ($500/month ad spend → $2-5K revenue)
4. **Affiliate program** (10 affiliates x 5 sales/month = 50 extra sales)
5. **1-on-1 coaching** ($500-1000/client - high ticket offer)

**Year 1 Revenue Trajectory:**
- Month 3: $2-5K (evergreen course sales)
- Month 6: $5-10K (paid ads, affiliates)
- Month 9: $10-20K (advanced course, coaching)
