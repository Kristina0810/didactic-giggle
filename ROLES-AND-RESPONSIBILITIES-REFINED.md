## 📖 Examples

### Example 1: New Feature

- CSV parser
- Job queue (BullMQ)
- Batch processing
- Progress tracking UI
- Email notification when done
- Storage considerations (100 images)
Estimated: 3 days
Questions: Max batch size? Priority order? Cost implications?"

**Orion:** "Approved. Starting now. Will have staging version tomorrow for your testing."

### Example 2: Production Issue

**Michael:** "Stripe webhook failing. Payments processing but credits not adding to accounts."

**Orion:** "Investigating... Found issue: webhook secret incorrect after last deploy. Fixing now."
[5 minutes later]
**Orion:** "Fixed and deployed. All pending webhooks reprocessed. Added monitoring alert for future. Credits now updating correctly."

**Michael:** "Confirmed working. Thanks for quick fix."

### Example 3: Strategic Decision

**Michael:** "Thinking of adding team accounts. Multiple users sharing credits. Would unlock enterprise market."

**Orion:** "Significant effort:
Option A: Full team features (3 weeks)
- Shared credits
- Role-based permissions
- Team billing
- Usage analytics

Option B: Simple version (1 week)
- Shared credits
- Basic permissions
- Individual billing

Recommendation: Start with Option B, validate demand, then Option A if needed."

**Michael:** "Good point. Let's do Option B first. Schedule it for Month 3 after we validate current features."

**Orion:** "Noted. Added to roadmap."
