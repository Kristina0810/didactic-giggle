## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Visionix AI

**One-Line Pitch:**
"Figma for AI image generation - professional designers create, iterate, and collaborate on AI-generated visuals in real-time"

**The Problem:**
Current AI image generators (Leonardo.ai, Midjourney) are optimized for single image creation. Professional designers working on client projects need to:
- Generate dozens of variations quickly
- Maintain consistent style across a project
- Collaborate with teammates in real-time
- Organize generations into projects
- Present iterations to clients

Existing tools force designers into a slow, disorganized workflow: generate one image, download, organize locally, repeat. No version control, no collaboration, no project management.

**Pain Intensity:** 8/10 - Designers spend 3-5 hours weekly on manual organization. Agencies lose billable hours to workflow friction.

**The Solution:**
Visionix AI is the first AI image generator built for professional workflows:
- **Canvas workspace** - Arrange generations spatially, not chronologically
- **Project organization** - Group work by client/project, not dumped in one feed
- **Real-time collaboration** - Share workspace, comment on generations, iterate together
- **Style consistency** - Lock style settings across all generations in a project
- **Version history** - Track all iterations, revert to any version
- **Client presentation mode** - Share read-only link for client feedback

**Why Our Solution is Better:**
1. **10x faster workflow** - Parallel generation + spatial organization vs linear feed
2. **Team-ready** - Only AI tool built for collaboration from day 1
3. **Professional features** - Project management, client sharing, version control
4. **Same AI quality** - SDXL under the hood, familiar to designers

**Vision (3 years):**
- **Year 1:** Standard tool for freelance designers (10K users, $500K ARR)
- **Year 2:** Adopted by design agencies (50K users, $5M ARR)
- **Year 3:** Enterprise offering for in-house design teams ($20M ARR, Series A)

**Market Opportunity:**
- TAM: 1.5M professional designers in US alone
- SAM: 500K using AI tools regularly
- SOM: 50K designers at agencies/studios (Year 3 target)
- At $40/user/month: $24M ARR potential in Year 3

## 🎨 Product Vision

### The Product

**Category:**
B2B SaaS - Vertical AI tool for professional designers

**Description:**
Visionix AI reimagines AI image generation for professional workflows. Instead of a feed-based, single-user experience, we provide a spatial canvas where teams collaborate on visual projects.

Imagine Figma's infinite canvas, but every element is AI-generated. Designers create a project for "Nike Summer Campaign", generate dozens of variations in parallel, arrange them spatially for comparison, comment with teammates, lock in the style, and share a presentation link with the client for feedback.

The core innovation is treating AI generation as a collaborative design process, not a slot machine. We maintain full generation history, enable style consistency across projects, and integrate with designer workflows (Figma import/export, Adobe sync, Slack notifications).

We're not competing on AI model quality (everyone uses the same models). We're winning on workflow efficiency and team collaboration.

**Core Value Proposition:**
"Cut AI generation workflow time from 5 hours to 30 minutes per project while maintaining professional quality"

**Competitive Advantages:**
1. **First-mover in collaboration** - Only AI tool with real-time team workspace
2. **Built for professionals** - Project management features others lack
3. **Agency relationships** - 20 agencies committed to beta, providing direct feedback loop
4. **Network effects** - Teams invite teams (viral within agencies)

### What We're NOT Building (Important!)

**Out of Scope:**
- ❌ Social network features (we're not Instagram for AI art)
- ❌ Marketplace (we're not selling user creations)
- ❌ Custom model training (too complex for MVP, maybe Year 2)
- ❌ Advanced editing tools (we integrate with Figma/Adobe, not replace)
- ❌ Animation/video (Phase 4+, not MVP)

**Why list this:** Keeps focus razor-sharp. These ideas will tempt us. We say no.

  - Consistent style evolution
  - Fast iteration (upscale, variations)
- What they do poorly:
  - Discord-based (not professional)
  - Zero organization (all in one feed)
  - No team features
  - Can't control canvas layout
- Our advantage:
  - Professional interface (not Discord)
  - Spatial canvas organization
  - Team collaboration built-in
  - Client-ready presentation mode

**3. Stable Diffusion (self-hosted)**
- What they do well:
  - Full control over models
  - Unlimited generations
  - No subscription (just GPU costs)
  - Customizable (LoRAs, extensions)
- What they do poorly:
  - Requires technical setup
  - No team collaboration
  - No organization tools
  - Intimidating for designers (not technical)
- Our advantage:
  - Zero setup (works immediately)

## 💪 Resources & Constraints

### Budget

**Total Available:** $50,000 (personal savings)

**Allocation:**
- Development (CTO Orion): Credits usage (~$500/month avg)
- Infrastructure: $200-700/month (scales with usage)
- Tools/Services: $100/month
- Marketing: $500/month (testing channels)
- Legal: $2,000 one-time (incorporate, legal docs)
- Miscellaneous: $1,000/month (buffer)

**Monthly Burn:** $2,300-3,300

**Runway:** 15-22 months (assuming zero revenue)

**Break-even goal:** Month 6 ($20K MRR)

**After break-even:** Reinvest profits into growth (paid ads, hire)

**Fundraising:**
- Bootstrapped until $1M ARR
- Raise Seed: $1-2M at $8-12M valuation (Month 18-24)
- Use case: Hire team (3 engineers, 1 marketing, 1 sales)

### Time Commitment

**My Availability (CEO Michael):**
- Hours per week: 40-50 hours
- Best working hours: 9am-6pm PST (some evenings/weekends)
- Days off: Sunday (recharge day)
- Blocked time:
  - Mornings (9-11am): Deep work (product strategy, user interviews)
  - Afternoons (2-5pm): Execution (testing, support, marketing)
  - Evenings: Respond to CTO Orion updates, review PRs

**Deadline Pressure:**
- Hard deadline: None (not a client project)
- Target: Launch in 8 weeks (realistic, not rushed)
- Flexible: If we need Week 9 for polish, that's OK
- Non-negotiable: No launch before it's ready (quality over speed)

**Other Commitments:**
- Full-time focus (no other jobs/projects)
- Family: Evenings after 7pm, Sundays off

### Technical Constraints

**Must Use:**
- TypeScript (type safety required)
- PostgreSQL (relational data needs)
- Next.js (SEO + performance critical)

**Cannot Use:**
- AWS (too expensive, too complex for MVP)
- Self-hosted infrastructure (no ops bandwidth)
- Proprietary/closed-source tools where open-source exists

**Preferences:**
- Serverless-first (scales automatically, pay-per-use)
- Managed services (focus on product, not DevOps)
- Best-in-class DX (Vercel, Neon, Clerk - premium tools OK if saves time)

### Red Flags (When to Pivot/Stop)

**Stop Signals (Kill Project):**
- **Month 6:** <100 paying customers (market doesn't want this)
- **Month 12:** <$10K MRR (not growing fast enough)
- **Anytime:** Churn >15%/month (broken product)
- **Anytime:** CAC > LTV (unit economics don't work)
- **Personal:** Hate working on it for 3+ months straight

**Pivot Signals (Change Direction):**
- Users asking for different feature constantly (different problem to solve)
- Different user segment more engaged (agencies vs freelancers, etc.)
- Better monetization model discovered (subscription vs credits, etc.)
- Competitor launches same thing but 10x better (rethink differentiation)

**When in Doubt:**
- Talk to 20 users
- Ask: "Would you be very disappointed if this product disappeared?"
- If <40% say "very disappointed" → pivot or stop
- (This is Sean Ellis test for product-market fit)

## 📝 Notes & Context

### Why This Product Now

**Market Timing:**
- AI image generation exploded in 2023-2024 (Midjourney, Leonardo.ai hit mainstream)
- Professionals using AI but frustrated with consumer tools
- Agencies starting to bill for AI design work (new service offering)
- Gap in market: No tool built specifically for professional/team use

**Personal Context:**
- Lived this pain for 2 years using AI tools for client work
- Watched Leonardo.ai grow to $10M ARR in 18 months (market validated)
- Agency friends saying "we need team features" (demand confirmed)
- Positioned to win: domain expertise + user access + market timing

**Why We'll Win:**
- Incumbents (Leonardo, Midjourney) focused on hobbyists
- Professionals underserved (our beachhead)
- Network effects (teams bring teams)
- Switching costs (once agency standardizes on us, sticky)

### Questions for Orion

**Before starting:**
1. Confirm: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui stack approved?
2. Confirm: Neon (PostgreSQL) + Prisma for database?
3. Confirm: Replicate for AI API (can switch to Modal/RunPod later)?
4. Canvas library recommendation? (Konva.js, React-Three-Fiber, custom?)
5. Real-time collaboration (Phase 2): Liveblocks vs Partykit vs custom?

**During build:**
6. When should Michael start beta testing? (Week 6 or 7?)
7. Infrastructure costs: Alert me if monthly costs exceed $500 in MVP phase

### Open Decisions

**Need Michael to decide before Week 1:**
- [ ] Product name (not Napolion - brainstorm 10 options)
- [ ] Logo concept (hire designer or AI-generate?)
- [ ] Launch date target (Week 9 = January X, 2025?)

**Need Michael to decide during build:**
- [ ] Canvas library choice (after Orion proposes options)
- [ ] Onboarding flow specifics (3-step wizard content)
- [ ] Email templates copy (welcome, purchase confirmation, etc.)
