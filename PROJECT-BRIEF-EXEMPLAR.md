# Project Brief - Dreamforge

**Purpose:** Complete project context for CTO Orion (Claude Code)
**Status:** Ready to Execute - 100% Finalized
**Last Updated:** November 14, 2025
**Version:** 3.0 (B2C Investor-Grade Final)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Dreamforge

**One-Line Pitch:**
"The creative playground for AI art - where anyone can generate, organize, and perfect stunning visuals in minutes, not hours"

**The Problem:**
AI image generation tools (Midjourney, Leonardo.ai) force users into a chaotic, feed-based experience. Creators generate dozens of variations trying to get the perfect image, but:
- Everything dumped in one endless chronological feed
- Can't organize by project or theme
- Lost good variations, can't find them again
- No way to compare variations side-by-side visually
- Download/upload manually to organize locally
- Share via screenshots (unprofessional)

**Pain Intensity:** 7/10 - Creators spend 2-3 hours weekly searching through feeds, reorganizing downloads, and recreating lost variations.

**The Solution:**
Dreamforge reimagines AI image generation with a **spatial canvas** (like Figma meets AI):
- **Infinite canvas** - Arrange generations spatially, not chronologically
- **Project organization** - Group work by theme/project, not dumped in one feed
- **Visual comparison** - Place variations side-by-side, choose the best
- **Full history** - Never lose a generation, revert to any version
- **Style consistency** - Lock style settings, generate cohesive sets
- **Easy sharing** - Share canvas links (not screenshots)

**Why Our Solution is Better:**
1. **10x better organization** - Spatial canvas vs endless scroll
2. **Never lose work** - Full history, not lost in feed
3. **Faster iteration** - Compare visually, not mentally
4. **Beautiful sharing** - Send links, not screenshots
5. **Same AI quality** - SDXL under the hood, familiar to creators

**Vision (3 years):**
- **Year 1:** Go-to tool for content creators (10K users, $2.4M ARR)
- **Year 2:** Standard for AI art community (50K users, $15M ARR)
- **Year 3:** Add prosumer/team features (100K users, $36M ARR, Series A)

**Market Opportunity:**
- TAM: 50M+ content creators globally (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- SAM: 10M creators using AI tools regularly
- SOM: 100K creators seeking better organization (Year 3 target)
- At $30/user/month: $36M ARR potential in Year 3

## 🎨 Product Vision

### The Product

**Category:**
B2C SaaS - Consumer AI tool for content creators and digital artists

**Description:**
Dreamforge reimagines AI image generation around a spatial canvas, not a chronological feed. Users create projects for different themes ("Cyberpunk Characters", "Fantasy Landscapes", "Logo Ideas"), generate multiple variations, and arrange them spatially for visual comparison.

Imagine an infinite canvas where every element is AI-generated. Create a "Character Design" project, generate 20 variations with different prompts, arrange the best 5 side-by-side for comparison, iterate on the winner, and share a beautiful link with friends.

The core innovation is treating AI generation as a **creative process**, not a slot machine. We maintain full generation history, enable style consistency across projects, and let creators organize work visually (not buried in feeds).

We're not competing on AI model quality (everyone uses the same models). We're winning on **workflow, organization, and user experience**.

**Core Value Proposition:**
"Find the perfect AI image in 10 minutes instead of 2 hours searching through endless feeds"

**Competitive Advantages:**
1. **Spatial organization** - Only tool with infinite canvas for AI generations
2. **Never lose work** - Full history, not lost in feed after 100 more generations
3. **Creator-first UX** - Built for humans, not Discord bots
4. **Fast iteration** - Visual comparison beats mental recall
